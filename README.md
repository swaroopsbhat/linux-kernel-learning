# linux-kernel-learning

This repository contains Linux kernel modules and character driver code
used during training and self-learning.

The code includes basic kernel module examples and experimental character
driver implementations created using reference materials and AI assistance.

The purpose of this repository is learning and understanding kernel module
flow, build process, and user-to-kernel interaction. The code is not
production-ready.
